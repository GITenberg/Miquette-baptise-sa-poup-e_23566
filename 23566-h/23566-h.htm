<h1>Miquette baptise sa poup&eacute;e</h1>
<hr />
<p class="c"><img src="images/001.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>Un beau matin, Miquette re&ccedil;oit une caisse. Elle l'ouvre et reste en
extase devant une magnifique poup&eacute;e boucl&eacute;e. Polo sifflote d'un air
indiff&eacute;rent.</p>

<p class="c"><img src="images/002a.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>&mdash;Tu vas voir, mon petit, si tu feras longtemps le d&eacute;daigneux, dit
Miquette. Je vais faire le bapt&ecirc;me de ma poup&eacute;e, et je parie que tu
seras bien content si je t'invite.</p>

<p class="c"><img src="images/002b.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>Miquette se pare de ses plus beaux atours pour aller chercher ses amis.</p>

<p>&laquo;Je ne suis vraiment pas mal&raquo; se dit-elle en contemplant sa toilette
dans la glace.</p>

<p class="c"><img src="images/003a.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>Tout d'abord, Miquette se rend chez sa petite cousine Jabotte.</p>

<p>&mdash;Veux-tu &ecirc;tre marraine de ma nouvelle fille; on fera le bapt&ecirc;me ce
soir?</p>

<p>Jabotte accepte avec joie.</p>

<p class="c"><img src="images/003b.png" alt="image" /></p>


<p>En chemin, Miquette voit venir un de ses petits camarades de jeux, le
turbulent Bobby et son ins&eacute;parable Gyp.</p>

<p class="c"><img src="images/004.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>&mdash;Bonjour Bobby, veux-tu &ecirc;tre le parrain de ma poup&eacute;e?</p>

<p>&mdash;Oui, dit Bobby, &agrave; condition que tu invites aussi Gyp.</p>

<p>&mdash;Entendu!</p>

<p class="c"><img src="images/005a.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>En sortant du cours de dessin, Miquette arr&ecirc;te son amie Rita:</p>

<p>&mdash;Y aura-t-il beaucoup de g&acirc;teaux au go&ucirc;ter? demande Rita.</p>

<p>&mdash;Mais oui, dit Miquette.</p>

<p>&mdash;Oh! alors je viendrai s&ucirc;rement, d&eacute;clare Rita.</p>

<p class="c"><img src="images/005b.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>En rentrant chez elle, Miquette s'arr&ecirc;te chez le p&acirc;tissier pour acheter
quelques friandises. Mais elle reste perplexe devant toutes les bonnes
choses &eacute;tal&eacute;es devant ses yeux.</p>

<p class="c"><img src="images/006a.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>Miquette se d&eacute;cide enfin &agrave; prendre quelques brioches, des &eacute;clairs et des
tartes aux cerises. Elle rentre chez elle en courant.</p>

<p class="c"><img src="images/006b.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>Son petit fr&egrave;re Polo la regarde d'un &#339;il curieux pendant qu'elle pr&eacute;pare
le go&ucirc;ter dans la tonnelle.</p>

<p class="c"><img src="images/007a.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>Aussi, pendant que Miquette est all&eacute;e s'habiller, Polo fait main basse
sur les g&acirc;teaux. Il ne s'arr&ecirc;te que lorsque les assiettes sont vides.
Bien s&ucirc;r il aura une indigestion!</p>

<p class="c"><img src="images/007b.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>Miquette descend en grande toilette.</p>

<p>&mdash;Vois, si je suis belle, dit-elle d'un air modeste.</p>

<p>Polo est un peu honteux de sa figure barbouill&eacute;e et de ses mains pleines
de cr&egrave;me.</p>

<p class="c"><img src="images/008a.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>Mais il n'est plus temps d'aller se changer, car voil&agrave; d&eacute;j&agrave; la marraine
charg&eacute;e de nombreux cadeaux. Miquette la prend par le cou:</p>

<p>&mdash;Viens voir ma poup&eacute;e ch&eacute;rie!</p>

<p class="c"><img src="images/008b.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>&mdash;Regarde ce que je t'ai apport&eacute;, dit Jabotte en d&eacute;pliant un charmant
bonnet et une robe de bapt&ecirc;me. Donne ta fille que je lui mette toutes
ces belles choses.</p>

<p class="c"><img src="images/009a.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>L'arriv&eacute;e de Bobby, un peu bruyante, avec Gyp, fait sursauter les
petites filles:</p>

<p>&mdash;J'apporte rien, d&eacute;clare Bobby en retournant ses poches, parce que j'ai
d&eacute;pens&eacute; tous mes sous &agrave; la Foire.</p>

<p class="c"><img src="images/009b.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>Voici enfin Rita. Polo court &agrave; sa rencontre. Il a un faible pour cette
bonne grosse qui aime tant les sucreries, comme lui:</p>

<p>&mdash;Viens Rita, tu seras ma cavali&egrave;re!</p>

<p class="c"><img src="images/010.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>Le cort&egrave;ge se forme, Jabotte portant la poup&eacute;e. Comme les cavaliers ne
sont pas assez nombreux, Gyp fait l'office d'un monsieur.</p>

<p class="c"><img src="images/011a.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>Bobby pr&eacute;tend nommer la poup&eacute;e: Bobine. La marraine proteste avec
&eacute;nergie.</p>

<p>&mdash;Tiens! dit Bobby furieux, en jetant de l'eau &agrave; la poup&eacute;e, voil&agrave;
comment je la baptise!</p>

<p class="c"><img src="images/011b.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>&mdash;Oh!!! s'&eacute;crient en ch&#339;ur les invit&eacute;s, et on pose la poup&eacute;e dans
l'herbe pour courir apr&egrave;s le coupable qui se sauve &agrave; toutes jambes.</p>

<p class="c"><img src="images/012a.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>Abandonnant Bobby, les invit&eacute;s se dirigent vers la tonnelle pour se
restaurer. Polo reste prudemment &agrave; l'&eacute;cart, se demandant ce qu'il
arrivera lorsqu'on aura d&eacute;couvert son larcin.</p>

<p class="c"><img src="images/012b.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>Les petites filles restent constern&eacute;es devant les assiettes vides. La
gourmande Rita a bien envie de pleurer.</p>

<p>Polo se tient coi.</p>

<p class="c"><img src="images/013a.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>&mdash;Voulez-vous que nous dansions un peu pour nous consoler? dit Miquette.</p>

<p>Les figures s'&eacute;clairent et l'on dit &laquo;oui&raquo; &agrave; l'unanimit&eacute;!</p>

<p class="c"><img src="images/013b.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>Le chagrin est bien vite oubli&eacute;. Polo ex&eacute;cute des pas de fantaisie,
croyant d&eacute;j&agrave; &ecirc;tre quitte de son m&eacute;fait.</p>

<p class="c"><img src="images/014a.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>Au beau milieu des r&eacute;jouissances, on voit arriver Gyp sautillant avec la
poup&eacute;e. Le bon toutou veut danser aussi.</p>

<p class="c"><img src="images/014b.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>Mais un affreux bruit de porcelaine bris&eacute;e fait accourir les invit&eacute;s.
Gyp reste stupide devant les d&eacute;bris de la poup&eacute;e.</p>

<p class="c"><img src="images/015.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>Miquette &eacute;clate en sanglots et chacun reste silencieux. Gyp, cause de
tout le mal, courbe le nez devant les remontrances de Bobby.</p>

<p class="c"><img src="images/016.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>Triste fin de f&ecirc;te. Les amis se s&eacute;parent. Miquette emporte les d&eacute;bris de
sa pauvre fille, tandis que Polo commence &agrave; ressentir le mal au c&#339;ur
caus&eacute; par sa gourmandise.</p>

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,

that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
